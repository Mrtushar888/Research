# Research

This code performs an analysis of a dataset related to the "Cosmic Wyverns" NFT collection. It extracts relevant information from the dataset, creates a DataFrame, and then performs an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to understand the impact of Rarity on various dependent variables. Additionally, it generates scatter plots to visualize the relationships between Rarity and the dependent variables.
## Data Analysis Steps

Data Extraction:

The code reads the dataset from a JSON file using the pandas library.
It extracts the required information such as Token ID, Collection Name, Collection Slug, Date, Total Number of Lists, Total Number of Offers, Average List Price, and Average Bid Price.
Data Transformation:

The code converts the date strings to datetime objects and creates a new column "Rarity" based on a specified condition.
Data Aggregation:

The code groups the data by "Token_id" and "Date" to calculate the required aggregations.
Data Visualization:

The code generates scatter plots to visualize the relationships between Rarity and Total Number of Lists, Total Number of Offers, Average List Price, and Average Bid Price.
OLS Regression:

The code uses the statsmodels library to perform OLS regression for each dependent variable (Total_Number_of_Lists, Total_Number_of_Offers, Average_List_Price, and Average_Bid_Price).
It prints the summary of each regression model, including coefficients, standard errors, t-values, p-values, and R-squared values.
## Interpretation of Results

The OLS regression models provide insights into the relationships between Rarity and the dependent variables. The R-squared values are relatively low, indicating that only a small proportion of the variance in the dependent variables can be explained by Rarity.

Total_Number_of_Lists and Total_Number_of_Offers:

Rarity has a statistically significant negative impact on both Total_Number_of_Lists and Total_Number_of_Offers. Higher Rarity values are associated with lower numbers of lists and offers.
Average_List_Price:

The model for Average_List_Price has missing values, and the results are invalid. Further investigation and handling of missing data are required for this analysis.
Average_Bid_Price:

Rarity has a statistically significant impact on Average_Bid_Price, but the R-squared value is negative, indicating a poor fit of the model to the data. This could be due to multicollinearity or other issues.


## Endogeneity Concerns

The provided analysis does not explicitly address endogeneity concerns. Potential endogeneity arises from the reverse causality between Rarity and the dependent variables. For example, higher Rarity values might be the result of higher demand or higher prices, rather than Rarity causing changes in the dependent variables.

To address endogeneity concerns, consider the following approaches:

Instrumental Variables (IV) Regression:

Identify instrumental variables that are correlated with Rarity but not directly with the dependent variables. IV regression helps establish a causal relationship between Rarity and the dependent variables, controlling for endogeneity.
Panel Data Analysis:

If the data is panel data with repeated observations over time for the same items, panel data techniques can control for unobserved heterogeneity and potential endogeneity.
Granger Causality Test:

Conduct a Granger causality test to determine the direction of causality between Rarity and the dependent variables.
Collecting Additional Data:

Obtain additional data that captures the underlying reasons for Rarity and its relationship with the dependent variables.
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):

Use SEM to model the complex relationships between Rarity and the dependent variables, considering latent variables and measurement error.
